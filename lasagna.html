        <li>1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until the meat is browned and the onion is tender. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 4 noodles on top of the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by 1 cup of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers twice, ending with meat sauce and remaining mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbly and the cheese is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna stand for 10 minutes before serving. Slice and enjoy!</li>
